# Data-Driven Vehicle Control Using CAN Protocol

## Project Overview

This embedded systems project demonstrates **data-driven vehicle control** via the **CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol**. The system involves real-time monitoring and control tasks such as engine temperature display, reverse alert, and window glass operation‚Äîsimulated through LEDs‚Äîacross multiple interconnected microcontroller nodes.

## Features

- üöó **Engine Temperature Display** using DS18B20 sensor
- üõë **Reverse Alert System** using GP2D12 proximity sensor
- ü™ü **Window Glass Control** using switch inputs and LED indicators
- üîÅ **CAN-Based Communication** between all functional nodes
- üìü LCD Display for real-time feedback
- üîî Audible and visual alerts

## System Architecture

The project consists of **three nodes** connected over a CAN Bus:

### 1. Main Node
- Reads and displays engine temperature
- Sends control commands to Window Glass Node
- Receives reverse alerts from Reverse Alert Node
- Uses external interrupts to detect switch presses

### 2. Window Glass Control Node
- Receives commands from Main Node
- Simulates window movement with LEDs

### 3. Reverse Alert Node
- Reads distance using GP2D12 sensor
- Sends reverse alert signal (logic 1 or 0) to Main Node based on object proximity
